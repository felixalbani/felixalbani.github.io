# About me

Hi there, and welcome to my blog! My name is Felix Albani, and I've been working in the IT industry for over 10 years now. Over the course of my career, I've had the pleasure of wearing many different hats, each of which has helped me build a strong foundation.

I started my career as a Developer, where I learned the ins and outs of software development. From there, I moved into Support, which gave me a customer-focused view of product development and taught me how to prioritize user needs and expectations.

Later on, I became a Solution Architect, which allowed me to apply my technical expertise and customer-oriented approach to designing solutions that meet the needs of the business. As a Solution Architect, I honed my skills in design and best practice processes, which have been invaluable in my career.

As I progressed in my career, I became increasingly interested in automation and innovation, which led me into management. As a manager, I've been able to leverage my technical knowledge and customer-oriented mindset to drive innovation and continuous improvement in my organization.

> Fun fact: In 2009 I founded a digital newspaper that covered local news in the city of San Martin, Mendoza, Argentina

Through this blog, I hope to share my insights and experiences with others who are passionate about the IT industry. Whether you're a developer, a manager, or just someone who's interested in learning more about the field, I hope that my posts will provide you with valuable insights and inspiration. Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
